      <p>1. When making components, always capitalize function name.</p>
      <p>2. File extension cna be .jsx or .js , because react is a library not a framework so there are less number of strict rules.</p>
      <p>3. Component (function) should return only 1 element (here that is fragment)</p>
      <p>4. Best practice is that file name should also be capitalized.</p>
    </>
